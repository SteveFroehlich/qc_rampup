# Complex Numbers

Code to get an understanding of complex numbers and 
tests to prove what you wrote is working. Operations 
to work through are:
* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division

Each operation has its own test 
[here](operations_test.py)
The class that needs to implement the
logic is [here](operations.py)

### Complex Division
Complex division a formula that may be hard to remember. 
There is a video that can help with recollection. (Especially 
if viewed via some spaced repetition) 
[video link](https://eight-ord-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ComplexDivision.mp4)
Or the last frame of the video with the formula is available as
a png image [here](https://eight-ord-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ComplexDivision.png)

The denominator in the division formula is also known as the
**modulus** of a complex number. The modulus is also the length
of the vector pointing to the point the complex number represents
in the complex plane. 

## Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with 
an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude, 
but the imaginary part is opposite in sign. 
For example given the complex number:
```
c = a + bi
```
The complex conjugate c_j is:
```
c_j = a - bi
```
