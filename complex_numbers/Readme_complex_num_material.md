# Complex Number Operations

### Complex Division
Complex division a formula that may be hard to remember. 
There is a video that can help with recollection. (Especially 
if viewed via some spaced repetition)

Or the last frame of the video with the formula is available as

The denominator in the division formula is also known as the
**modulus** of a complex number. The modulus is also the length
of the vector pointing to the point the complex number represents
in the complex plane. 

## Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with 
an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude, 
but the imaginary part is opposite in sign. 
For example given the complex number:
```
c = a + bi
```
The complex conjugate c_j is:
```
c_j = a - bi
```

Any number in the set of complex numbers has the properties:
1. Addition is commutative and associative
2. Multiplication is commutative and associative
3. Addition has an identity (0,0)
4. Multiplication has an identity (1,0)
5. Multiplication distributes with respect to addition
6. Subtraction is defined everywhere
7. Division is defined everywhere except when the divisor is zero
